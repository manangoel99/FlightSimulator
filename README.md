Rules
===========
-   The player starts the game with a score of 0, Full Health and Full Fuel on the top left corner.
-   The goal is to collect as many checkpoints as possible.
-   The player shall face 3 types of obstacles in their journey, there are canons guarding each checkpoint, Enemies shall come down on parachutes and shoot bullets at you.
-   Contact with any of the three obstacles will lead to an instant loss of health.
-   Beware of the fuel it will deplete as time passes.
-   As the game progresses you'll find power ups like a 'Life' which will increase your health and 'Fuel Refills'.
-   A checkpoint can be collected only when the canon guarding it is destroyed.
-   Flying over Volcanoes is a complete no-no and will lead to immediate termination.
-   There are also Smoke Rings passing through which will fetch extra points.
